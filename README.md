# gctx
gctx is a small go executable that aims to simplify switching between multiple git users.

## Installation
> **Note**
> Before you can use gctx, you have to create a `users.yml` file in your configuration directory/gctx/users.yml
> You can look at the example file to understand the syntax.

After that, simply install the executable with:
`go install github.com/tomromeo/gctx/cmd/gctx@latest`
